# xbase (WIP: 0.1)

## üëÅ Overview 

Xcode replacement-ish development environment for neovim. Currently requires and recommends using [XcodeGen] as a way to configure and generate xcode projects.

It is still work in progress, if you have something in mind or found a bug open an issue.

## üåü Features:

* **Auto-Completion and Code navigation**\
    [sourcekit-lsp] doesn't support auto-indexing. Therefore, [xbase] includes a custom build
    server that auto-generate compiled command on directory changes (i.e. file removed/added).
* **multi-nvim instance support**\
    Thanks to having a single daemon running and simple client/server architecture, users can have and use multiple nvim instance running without process duplications and shared state. E.g. stop watch service ran from different nvim instance.
* **Auto-start/stop main background daemon**\
    No need to manual start/stop daemon background. The daemon will auto start/stop based on
    connect neovim (client instances)
* **Multi Target/Project Support**\
    Users can develop across different projects and build/run on root directory changes or once.
* **Simulator Support**\
    Pick a simulator devices relative to target platform and run the target once or per file changes. If the simulator isn't running then it will auto launch it.
* **Logging buffer**\
  real-time logging of print statements and build logs. This feature depends partially on
  [xcodebuild] crate which is still work-in-progress and might not print errors.
* **Statusline Support**\
    Global variable to update statusline with build/run commands + [feline] provider. Other
    statusline plugins support are welcomed.
* **No footprint**\
    light resource use. I've been using xbase for a while now, usually 0.0% cpu and 0.1% memory.


## üåù Motivation

After purchasing a MacBook, I decided to get into iOS/macOS applications development. Though, coming from vim/shell development experience and being heavily keyboard driven, I could not handle the switch to closed sourced, opinionated mouse, driven development environment. I tried workarounds such as xvim2 and builtin vim emulator but still I'd catch myself often looking for my mouse. 

Therefore, being a long time vim user and having previously develop few lua/nvim plugins, I decided to take sometime to invest in both creating a fairly complicated development environment and expand my experience with coding in rust. 

## Installation

packer.nvim:

```lua 
use { 'tami5/xbase', run = 'make install' }
```

## üéÆ Usage

Currently, once you start a neovim instance where it has root has `project.yml`, the daemon server will auto-start if no instance is running, then the root will be registered for recompile-watch.

From there, you have a telescope picker

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufEnter", "BufWinEnter" }, {
  pattern = { "*.m", "*.swift", "*.c", "*.yml" },
  callback = function()
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ef", require("xbase.pickers").actions, { buffer = true })
  end,
})
-- so that on a new buffer it would work
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ef", require("xbase.pickers").actions, { buffer = true })
```

### Configuration (defaults)
```lua 
{
  --- Log level. Set to error to ignore everything: { "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error" }
  log_level = "debug",
  --- Default log buffer direction: { "horizontal", "vertical", "float" }
  default_log_buffer_direction = "horizontal",
  --- Statusline provider configurations
  statusline = {
    running = { icon = "‚öô", color = "#e0af68" },
    success = { icon = "ÔÖä", color = "#1abc9c" },
    failure = { icon = "Ôôô", color = "#db4b4b" },
    show_progress = false,
  },
  --- TODO(nvim): Limit devices platform to select from
  simctl = {
    iOS = {
      "iPhone 13 Pro",
      "iPad (9th generation)",
    },
  },
}

```

## Preview

Watch build service. 

![](./media/statusline_watch.gif)

On error it opens a log buffer where you can inspect what went wrong, otherwise only the
statusline get updated.

> NOTE: this is using a custom feline provider located in `watch.lua`, pr is welcome for other statusline support.
